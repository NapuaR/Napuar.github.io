    <p>Fred is a middle-aged man of 35, is the owner of his own company and thus
      has a busy work schedule and is always on the go. Because of this he spends
      all his time browsing on his mobile phone. He hates carrying around extra layers,
      loves to be dressed just for the weather. As such when he visits "weatherme.us"
      he expects to see today's current weather coditions and any changes that may take
      place so he can plan accordingly. He values strong communication, timely reports,
      and a clear fulfillment of expectations. Orderly, timely and a well-respected office
      man, this is Fred.
